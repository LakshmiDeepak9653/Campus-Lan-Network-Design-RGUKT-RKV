<font color="red">Founding of RGUKT</font>
<p>
<li>The idea to create RGUKT germinated in April 2007, at a meeting between Prof. D.Raj Reddy and Prof. K.C. Reddy who then took idea to the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Dr. Y.S.Rajashekar Reddy.</li>
<li>Dr. YSR by then was not happy with the opportunities available to the rural youth and wanted to start a University modeled on IIIT to exclusively concentrate on rural youth in imparting technology oriented higher education for bettering their employment potential</li>
<li>In March of 2008, the AP Government created RGUKT with three campuses through an Act of the Legislature as a full-fledged university which would initially admit approximately the top 1% of the rural students into the three residential campuses located at RK Valley, Basara and Nuzvid.</li></p>

<font color="red">Why RGUKT?</font>
<p>A person born into a low income, rural family in India struggles to aspire to study at an IIT or aim to be selected into the IAS. This is true in many cases. The reason for this is because they start with many inherent disadvantages such as:</p>
<li>The educational level of the parents</li>
<li>The quality of teachers and the schools they go to</li>
<li>The ability to pay for coaching classes, and;</li>
<li>The time and effort devoted to study the material;</li>
<p><t>It has been observed that, on an average, the marks obtained by the students in rural India are about 10-20% lower than the marks of students studying in private schools of urban India. As a result, most of the seats for higher education get filled by students from these private schools when the basis of selection is the marks obtained. Even if a rural student is capable, the educational system doesn't allow him to go ahead. The goal of RGUKT is to help remedy this unfortunate situation.</p>
