<h3><font color="red">Education at the RGUKT</font></h3>
<font color="blue">Features of Six - Years Integrated Course:</font>
<p>
The program offered by the RGUKT consists of a six year integrated course after 10th class examination leading to a B.Tech. degree. The first part of the six-year course is a two-year Pre University Course (equivalent to (AP) Intermediate) followed by a second part of four-year Engineering Course. At present the pre-university part of education offers premature specialization in tracks such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Life sciences (equivalent to MPC + BiPC). By bringing students in to the University at an earlier stage we hope to impart a broad based education including humanities and liberal arts to students.</p>
</div>
<div>
<font color="blue">Employment Prospects:</font>
<p>It is expected that the employment prospects of graduates of RGUKT (IIITs) will be comparable to the other world class universities in India. It is also anticipated that the broad-based education including soft skills will provide a strong foundation for national competitive examinations. Appropriate placement guidance and awareness programs will be conducted to prepare the students for private and public sector opportunities. Students also learn entrepreneurship and other skills that can help them to set out on their own.</p>
</div>
<div>
<font color="blue">Tuition Fees:</font>
<p>As a government sponsored university, the tuition fees at Rajiv Gandhi University are highly subsidized by the AP government. The annual fee (for AP students) for the first two years (Pre University program) is Rs.36,000/-. This includes tuition, lodging and boarding.</p>
</div>
<div>
<font color="blue">Focus on Liberal and Professional Education Including Soft Skills:</font>
<p>The program at RGUKT (IIITs) is built on a new model of liberal professional education creating future leaders with a broad understanding of the world. A structured environment of broad based education including basic skills of communication, teamwork and leadership is provided.</p>
</div>
<div>
<font color="blue">Life in a Residential Campus:</font>
<p>As a fully residential program, all students will stay on the campus. The program is intensive and runs for 3 semesters of 16 weeks of 6 days a week each. Only 6 weeks of vacation is permitted: 1 week in Dasara, 1 week during Sankranthi and four weeks in summer. While the program appears intensive, it is also designed to help absorption by making students apply concepts right-then-and-there in class.</p>
</div>
<div>
<font color="blue">Career Development and Placement Cell (CDPC):</font>
<p>Career Development and Placement Cell (CDPC) at RGUKT, R.K.Valley is dedicated to enriching the students of the institute as competent and efficient human resources for the nation.
